# Pomodoro Clock
A productivity app based on the Pomodoro Technique at Hebrew.

Built using HTML, CSS, [the Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com/), JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:
* Customize work, break, and extended break times.
* Sound alert when the current session starts and ends.
* Track the number of sessions that have been completed.
* After 4 "work" sessions, the clock will default to an extended break time instead of a normal break time.
* Pause current session or completely reset the app.
